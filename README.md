One of nature's most priceless and exquisite creations is the diamond. Diamonds are among the rarest gemstones in the world, making them more sought-after and pricier. Given their financial benefits, diamonds are highly desired in the investment market. Therefore, it is crucial for diamond merchants to provide an accurate price prediction. The ability of investors and purchasers to forecast the price of diamonds is quite challenging and complex due to the wide diversity in the shapes, sizes and qualities of diamonds. 

Machine learning algorithms can be used to forecast diamond pricing by using their features in an effort to alleviate this issue. Among the algorithms the model was tested upon, the ensemble learning method algorithm, Random Forest Regression was found to be the most suitable as it performed the best based on the metrics; R-squared, RMSE, and RAE. Random Forest had the highest R-squared value (0.972) which means that the independent variables of the model are able to explain 97.2% of the variation in diamond prices. It also had the lowest MAE and RMSE (671.860) which implies that the average deviation between the predicted price of diamond and the actual price is $671.86.
